\item{run_checks}{\code{logical} flag indicating whether presolve checks
should be run prior solving the problem. These checks are performed using
the \code{\link{presolve_check}} function. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.
Skipping these checks may reduce run time for large problems.}

made to solve the problem even if potential issues were detected during
the presolve checks. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\value{
A \code{numeric}, \code{matrix},
  \code{\link[raster]{RasterLayer-class}}, or
  \code{\link[sp]{Spatial-class}} object containing the replacement costs
  for each planning unit in the solution.

\description{

\details{
Note that all arguments to \code{solution} must correspond
  to the planning unit data in the argument to \code{x} in terms
  of data representation, dimensionality, and spatial attributes (if
  applicable). This means that if the planning unit data in \code{x}
  is a \code{numeric} vector then the argument to \code{solution} must be a
  \code{numeric} vector with the same number of elements, if the planning
  unit data in \code{x} is a \code{\link[raster]{RasterLayer-class}} then the
  argument to \code{solution} must also be a
  \code{\link[raster]{RasterLayer-class}} with the same number of rows and
  columns and the same resolution, extent, and coordinate reference system,
  if the planning unit data in \code{x} is a \code{\link[sp]{Spatial-class}}
  object then the argument to \code{solution} must also be a
  \code{\link[sp]{Spatial-class}} object and have the same number of spatial
  features (e.g. polygons) and have the same coordinate reference system,
  if the planning units in \code{x} are a \code{data.frame} then the
  argument to \code{solution} must also be a \code{data.frame} with each
  column correspond to a different zone and each row correspond to
  a different planning unit, and values correspond to the allocations
  (e.g. values of zero or one).

  Solutions must have planning unit statuses set to missing (\code{NA})
  values for planning units that have missing (\code{NA}) cost data. For
  problems with multiple zones, this means that planning units must have
  missing (\code{NA}) allocation values in zones where they have missing
  (\code{NA}) cost data. In other words, planning units that have missing
  (\code{NA}) cost values in \code{x} should always have a missing
  (\code{NA}) value the argument to \code{solution}. If an argument is
  supplied to
  \code{solution} where this is not the case, then an error will be thrown.
